This project is developed by using MEAN (MongoDB, express.js, Angular, Node.js). MEAN is a set of Open source components that together, provide an end-to-end framework for building dynamic web applications. The stack is made up of:

- **M**ongoDB: Document database

- **E**xpress: Back-end Node.js web application framework

- **A**ngular: Front-end web application framework

- **N**ode.js: JavaScript runtime environment

## Live Demo
This project is deployed in [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Please visit (https://task-planner-application.herokuapp.com/) or click [LIVE DEMO](https://task-planner-application.herokuapp.com/) to preview the application.
## Wireframe
I used [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/in/products/xd.html) to design this application wireframe.

## Platforms
In this application, I used [Node.js(10.16.1)](https://nodejs.org/), [Express.js(4.17.1)](https://expressjs.com/) as the back-end, [Angular 8](https://angular.io/) as the Front-end and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) as a database. I used [postman](https://www.postman.com/) platform for API request & Response and [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as an IDE.
## Development Server
This project is divided into two folder structure, one is backend folder where all the node.js, express.js code stays their and rest of the files are Angular 8(Front-end).

- **To run backend:**
Open the terminal and navigate to the backend folder in the project. Run `npm i` to install all the needed packages from npm, after the process finished. Run `npm run dev` in the terminal. The server is listing to the port 3000. Make sure you should install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) application in your PC

- **To run frontend:**
Open another terminal and navigate to the project folder. Run `npm i` to install all the needed packages for the application, after the process finished. Run `ng serve` in the terminal to run the developement server of the Angular. Make sure you should install [Angular cli](https://cli.angular.io/) before running `ng serve` in the terminal. Then open browser and enter the url `http://localhost:4200` to run the application.
