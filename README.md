This project is developed by using MEAN (MongoDB, express.js, Angular, Node.js). MEAN is a set of Open source components that together, provide an end-to-end framework for building dynamic web applications. The stack is made up of:

- MongoDB: Document database

- Express: Back-end Node.js web application framework

- Angular: Front-end web application framework

- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment

## Live Demo

## Wireframe


## Platforms
In this application, I used Node.js, express.js as the back-end, Angular 8 as the Front-end and MongoDB as a database. I used Postman platform for API request & Response and VScode as an IDE.
## Development Server
This project is divided into two folder structure, one is backend folder where all the node.js, express.js code stays their and rest of the files are Angular 8(Front-end).

- **To run backend:**
Open the terminal and navigate to the backend folder in the project. Run `npm i` to install all the needed packages from npm, after the process finished. Run `npm run dev` in the terminal. The server is listing to the port 3000. Make sure you should install MongoDB application in your PC

- **To run frontend:**
Open another terminal and navigate to the project folder. Run `npm i` to install all the needed packages for the application, after the process finished. Run `ng serve` in the terminal to run the developement server of the Angular. Make sure you should install Angular cli before running `ng serve` in the terminal. Then open browser and enter the url `http://localhost:4200` to run the application.
